1 - a. Too easy.  The pattern is predicatable between squares and balls.  There should be random spawing of the squares and balls in various orders
	b. Too easy.  The spawn times are very predicatable.  They should spawn at a random time vs. at the consistent spawn every 5 seconds.

2 - a. To make harder - Add code to make squares move back and forth at a random speed / distance.
	b. To make harder - Change the ratio of powerups vs. squares

3 - a. Add sound effects.
	b. Make powerups explode with effects

4 - a. Trying to get to a certain time goal
	b. Being able to dodge squares

5 - a. Moving left and right at slower speed.  Hard to go between blocks and balls in most cases
	b. Slowing down when hit square.  It throws the rythm off.  There should be a time penalty, not slow penalty.

Changes:
Obstacles - Changed light from red to blue
Particles - Added change color over time
