1.  It is challenging, but not to the point where it is frustrating and makes the player want to quit
2.  Something that may make it more challenging is adding in a couple of obstacles
3.  Having a graphics such as fireworks when the game is completed would give it a wow factor
4.  It is fun trying to get the balls into their respective goals.  I think having too many balls on the playfield at one time makes it more tedious

Suggestions:

[x] 1. Making variations of the chaos balls.  Made of different mats and sizes
[x] 2. Making water sounds when walking
[x] 3. changing size of bumper
[x] 4. complex shapes for bumpers
